/** @file decode.c
*	 @brief implementation of decoding strategy for an encoded wav file
*
* With this function we take a WAV file that supposedly has an encrypted
* message within its data segment. By receating the exact
* same permutations table using the same key we basically follow the 
* reverse procedure of encoding. That means finding the "random" x-th byte
* of the data segment via the permutations table which contains the i-th
* bit in its least significant bit. We store that bit using bitwise operation
* &1. The way it works is that when a bit is zero if we bit-and it with
* one we will get zero, if it is one and-ing it with one will once again
* grant as one. The tactic that I followed is storing each bit to char table
* and every time the table has 8 bits stored it means that we have completed 
* a single byte(char) so we can proceed to add that char to the final
* message. A very useful method for this was @see strtol().

/** @brief This is the function where the actual decoding takes place.
* In this fucntion we essentialy take as parameters the data segment of
* the wav file and the length of the message which is supposedly known 
* beforehand. By length we mean the number of all characters including
* normal printable ASCII characters, newLines spaces tabs AND the '\0'
* character which indicates the end of the string. It is vital to
* be completely clear that the length we give as a parameter is the 
* number of characters INCLUDING the null character '\0' in this herein
* implementation. We create the same permutation table that was creating in
* the encoding process and then in a for-loop we begin the decoding.
* The first bit of the message is stored in the x-th bit of the data segment
* where x is the number given by the i-th place of the same permutation
* table used in encoding. This is the only way to decode the correct bytes.
* We get the bit by bitwise and-ing it with 1 in its least significant bit
* (we don't have to shift since it is the last bit) and then store that
* bit in string which,when completed(8 bits for a byte) is essentlially
* the binary representation of the character. Then through the usage of
* functions like @see strtol() we process that binary string and turn it
* to its printable char form. We do this for all bits of the message until
* we have recreated all the characters and stored them to a final string 
* which is the decoded message.
